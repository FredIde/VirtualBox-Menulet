This is a fork of the original [VirtualBox Menulet](http://statusmenus.sourceforge.net/) application with a few tweaks.
Specifically, the icons have been cleaned up a bit, and the code has been altered to work with a dark Menubar in OSX/macOS.

## Contact
Part of the reason I forked this project is that the original developer appears to have abanndonned this project.  You
can try emailing <support@kiwifruitware.tk>, but don't expect a response.  Leave me an issue here but be warned: I am
definitely *not* a macOS developer.  I just hacked at this until I got what I wanted.  Improvements are more than welcome.
